Buffalo aims to make building new web applications in Go as quick and simple as possible, and what could be more simple than a *new application* generator? Start by going to your `$GOPATH` and create your new application!

<%= code("text") { %>
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/$USER/
$ # Make sure $GOPATH/bin is in your $PATH, then:
$ buffalo new <name>
<% } %>

That will generate a whole new Buffalo application that is ready to go. It'll even run `go get` for you to make sure you have all of the necessary dependencies needed to run your application.

$ buffalo new coke

Congratulations! Your application, coke, has been successfully built!

You can find your new application at:
.../coke

Please read the README.md file in your new application for next steps on running your application.

To see a list of available flags for the `new` command, just check out its help.

<%= code("text") { %>
$ buffalo help new
<% } %>

Note: by default, Buffalo generates a database.yml targeted for postgres. If you wish to change this behavior, you can pass in a `--db-type` flag into the `new` command.

<%= code("text") { %>
$ buffalo new coke --db-type sqlite3
<% } %>

If your app doesn't need a database, or if you want to handle it by yourself, you can use the `--skip-pop` flag.

<%= code("text") { %>
$ buffalo new coke --skip-pop
<% } %>

<%= title("Building Your Application", {name: "building"}) %>

Buffalo features a command, `build`, that will build a full binary of your application including, but not limited to; assets, migrations, templates, etc... If you buy into the "Buffalo Way" things just work. It's a wonderful experience. :)

<%= code("text") { %>
$ buffalo build
<% } %>

<%= code("text") { %>
