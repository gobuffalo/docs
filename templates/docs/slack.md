The `#buffalo` Slack channel on [gophers.slack.com](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/buffalo/) is great place to ask for help from a variety of Buffalo developers and Gophers.

In order to access the Gophers Slack, and the `#buffalo` channel, you first need to get an invitation. This can be done by going to [https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/) and requesting an invitation.

Once you're in Slack, please join the `#buffalo` channel and say "Hello"! We'd love to hear from you.
