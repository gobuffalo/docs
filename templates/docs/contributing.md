<%= title("Funding") %>

If you like, or love, Buffalo, please consider funding its development.

With funding I will be able to focus on Buffalo development full-time. This means faster turn around times on bugs, issues, and features. It also means more time spend on documentation and learning materials such as blog posts, videos, and possibly a book.

We are fortunate, as a community, to have so many great packages written by some really great people. Buffalo wraps all of those packages together with a little glue to bring it all together. A great place to start making Buffalo better is to help improve the underlying packages Buffalo relies on.
