## Creating a new Buffalo App (and router)

The app configuration is located in the `app.go` file.

```go
a := buffalo.New(buffalo.Options{
  Env:         ENV,
  SessionName: "_coke_session",
})
```

The default setup should handle most of your needs, but you are free to customize it to fit your use case.
