The Buffalo team needs, and wants your help! We're doing our best to make the world a better place for Go web development, but we can't do it alone.

If you want to contribute, please read this article first: [Contributing to Open Source Git Repositories in Go](https://splice.com/blog/contributing-open-source-git-repositories-go/). It shows how to configure your `git` environment to avoid common pitfalls. This article is recommended to all those who are looking to contribute to any Go projects.

## Funding

If you like, or love, Buffalo, please consider funding its development.

With funding I will be able to focus on Buffalo development full-time. This means faster turn around times on bugs, issues, and features. It also means more time spend on documentation and learning materials such as blog posts, videos, and possibly a book.

## Shoulders of Giants

We are fortunate, as a community, to have so many great packages written by some really great people. Buffalo wraps all of those packages together with a little glue to bring it all together. A great place to start making Buffalo better is to help improve the underlying packages Buffalo relies on.
