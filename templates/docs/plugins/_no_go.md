## Writing Non-Go Plugins

Plugins do not need to be written in Go. They can be written in any language you would like, as long as they comply with the rules above.

For example, we can write the following plugin using Ruby:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# ./plugins/buffalo-hello.rb

require 'json'

command = ARGV[0]

case command
when 'available'
  puts JSON.generate([{ name: 'hello', buffalo_command: 'root', description: 'says hello to you' }])
when 'hello'
  puts 'Hi there!'

end
```

To activate the plugin we need to add the file as `buffalo-hello.rb` to somewhere in the `$PATH` or in a directory called `plugins/` inside of a Buffalo application.

Finally the file needs to be made executable. On a Mac/Linux it can be done with `chmod +x buffalo-hello.rb`.

```bash
$ buffalo plugins list
