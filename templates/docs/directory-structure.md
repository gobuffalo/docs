<%= h1("Directory structure") %>

Buffalo provides you **a minimal directory structure** to work on your project. This structure **keeps the project clean**, and allow the [generators](/docs/generators) to work. Don't try to reinvent the wheel, and **let Buffalo buy you more time** to do the interesting part of your app! :)

Now that you have a minimal new project, let's go through its contents.

## The root directory

Here is the structure of a Buffalo project:

* `go/` &mdash; GOPATH root.
	* `src/` &mdash; Go sources directory
		* `github.com/username/myapp/` &mdash; your app root
			* `actions/`
			* `assets/`
			* `grifts/`
			* `locales/`
			* `models/`
			* `public/`
			* `templates/`
			* `tmp/`
			* `database.yml`
			* `main.go`

### actions

This directory handles the **Controller** part of the MVC pattern. It contains the handlers for your URLs, plus:

* the `app.go` file to setup your app & routes,
* the `render.go` file to setup the template engine(s).

### assets

<%= note() { %>
This directory is optional. If you don't need to use a frontend setup (API only, for instance), it can be removed.
<% } %>

This directory contains **raw** assets which will be compiled/compressed & put in the [`public`](#public) directory.

### grifts

<%= note() { %>
This directory is optional. If you don't need to use [tasks](/docs/tasks), you can remove it.
<% } %>

This directory contains the [tasks](/docs/tasks) powered by [grift](https://github.com/markbates/grift).

### locales

<%= note() { %>
This directory is optional. If you use only one language, you can remove it and the i18n module from the `app.go` file in the `actions` directory.
<% } %>

This directory is used by the <abbr title="internationalization">i18n</abbr> system. It will fetch the translation strings from here.

### models

<%= note() { %>
If you use pop/soda with the integrated generator, it will generate the model files here.
<% } %>

<%= note() { %>
This directory is optional. If you don't need to use a database, it can be removed.
<% } %>

This directory handles the **Model** part of the MVC pattern. It contains the `models.go` file to initialize the datasource connection, and the model files to reflect objects from the datasource.

### public

<%= note() { %>
The contents of this directory are auto-generated.
<% } %>

This directory contains the public (compiled/compressed) assets. If you use webpack, it will put its assets in this directory.

### templates

<%= note() { %>
This directory is optional. If you don't need to use a frontend setup (API only, for instance), it can be removed.
<% } %>

This directory handles the **View** part of the MVC pattern. It contains the project templates, used to render the views.

### tmp

<%= note() { %>
The contents of this directory are auto-generated.
<% } %>

This directory is used by the `buffalo dev` command to rebuild your project on every change. The temporary files that Buffalo works with are put here.

### database.yml

<%= note() { %>
This file is optional. If you don't need a database, or if you want to handle the database without pop/soda, you can remove it.
<% } %>

This file contains the database configuration for [pop/soda](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop).

### main.go

This file bootstraps your app and starts it.
