## Finding Available Plugins

A full list of Plugins can be found at [https://toolkit.gobuffalo.io/tools?topic=plugin](https://toolkit.gobuffalo.io/tools?topic=plugin).

To get your project listed on the Buffalo Toolkit you must tag your project on GitHub with `gobuffalo`.

There are a few more tags that you can use that will help the Buffalo Toolkit better categorize your project. You can add as many of this tags to your project as is suitable. Please try to refrain from using more than just a few tags.

* `plugin` - Plugins
* `generator` - Generators
* `middleware` - Middleware
* `pop` - Pop/Soda
* `templating` - Templating
* `grifts` - Grift Tasks
* `deployment` - Deployment
* `testing` - Testing
* `example` - Example Apps
* `worker` - Workers/Adapters
* `webpack` - Webpack/Front-End

Any other tags will still be indexed and searchable, but the tool may not show in the "known" categories section.
