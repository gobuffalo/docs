<%= h1("Mailers") %>

E-mails are part of most (web) systems. It's a standard way to inform users about platform news, confirmations, marketing stuff, and so on.

Buffalo provides, out of the box, a mailer extension with a standard SMTP sender. A generator is included, to allow you to work with emails as fast as possible.
