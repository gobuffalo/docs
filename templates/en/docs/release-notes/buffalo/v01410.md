## Critical Security Fix

Resolves a critical security issue in the `packr` dependency. This issue would allow an unauthenticated attacker to read any file from the buffalo application's filesystem. This could be used to steal information and retrieve sensitive credentials (via the `.env` file or similar).

The attack path is via the `app.ServeFiles()` call and its use of `packr` for the assetsBox. Requests for static files through this path **do not create log entries** and upstream logs from a load balancer or TLS proxy would needed to determine if the issue was exploited.

The attack leverages a directory traversal, specifically a request like:
`..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5cetc%5cpasswd`

This issue affected all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and anyone using a version of `packr` prior to `v2.6.0` or `buffalo` prior to `v0.14.10` should upgrade immediately.
