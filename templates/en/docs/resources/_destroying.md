## Destroying Resources

You can remove files generated by this generator by running:

```bash
$ buffalo destroy resource users
```

This command will ask you which files you want to remove, you can either answer each of the questions with y/n or you can pass the `-y` flag to the command like:

```bash
$ buffalo destroy resource users -y
```

Or in short form:

```bash
$ buffalo d r users -y
```
